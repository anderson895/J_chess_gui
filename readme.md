## 🔧 Configuration

### Database Location

By default, the database is saved in the same folder as the program:
```
your_folder/
├── chess_arena.py
└── chess_arena.db  ← Auto-created
```

**To change database location:**

Edit line ~665 in the code:
```python
# Current (same folder as program):
self.db_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "chess_arena.db")

# Alternative (custom location):
self.db_path = "C:/MyChessData/chess_arena.db"  # Windows
self.db_path = "/home/user/chess/chess_arena.db"  # Linux/Mac
```

### Engine Settings

**Stronger Play (Longer Thinking Time):**
```
Move time (ms): 5000-10000
```

**Faster Games (Shorter Thinking Time):**
```
Move time (ms): 500-1000
```

**Match Speed (Move Delay):**
```
Move delay (s): 0 = No delay (fast)
Move delay (s): 1-2 = Good for watching
```

## 📦 Building Executables

### Windows Executable (.exe)

**Using PyInstaller:**

1. **Install PyInstaller**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create Executable**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=assets/logo.ico --add-data "chess_arena.db;." chess_arena.py

   ```

3. **Find Your .exe**
   ```
   dist/ChessArena.exe  ← Distribute this file
   ```

**With Custom Icon (Optional):**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Engine Not Found
**Problem**: "Engine not found" error

**Solution**:
- Verify the engine file exists
- Check file permissions (Linux/Mac: `chmod +x engine_file`)
- Ensure full path is correct

### No UCI Response
**Problem**: Engine doesn't respond

**Solution**:
- Make sure engine is UCI-compatible
- Try a different engine (e.g., Stockfish)
- Check engine version compatibility

### Database Error
**Problem**: Database write errors

**Solution**:
- Check folder write permissions
- Ensure disk space available
- Delete `chess_arena.db` to reset

### Board Not Updating
**Problem**: Board frozen during game

**Solution**:
- Click STOP GAME
- Restart the application
- Check if engines are still running

## 📊 Database Schema

The SQLite database stores game data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE games (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    white_engine TEXT NOT NULL,
    black_engine TEXT NOT NULL,
    result TEXT NOT NULL,           -- "1-0", "0-1", "1/2-1/2"
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,            -- "Checkmate", "Stalemate", etc.
    date TEXT NOT NULL,              -- "2025.02.17"
    time TEXT NOT NULL,              -- "14:30:22"
    pgn TEXT NOT NULL,               -- Full PGN notation
    move_count INTEGER,              -- Number of moves
    duration_seconds INTEGER         -- Game duration
);
```

**View Database:**
- Use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
- Or Python: `sqlite3 chess_arena.db`

## 🎓 FAQ

**Q: Can I use any chess engine?**
A: Yes! Any UCI-compatible engine works. Stockfish, Komodo, Leela Chess Zero, etc.

**Q: How do I make engines play stronger?**
A: Increase "Move time (ms)" to 5000-10000. More time = stronger play.

**Q: Can I watch games in slow motion?**
A: Yes! Increase "Move delay (s)" to 1-2 seconds.

**Q: Where are my games saved?**
A: In `chess_arena.db` in the same folder as the program.

**Q: Can engines use opening books?**
A: Yes, if the engine has opening books configured, they work automatically.

**Q: Can I run this on Raspberry Pi?**
A: Yes! Python 3.7+ and Tkinter are available on Raspberry Pi OS.

**Q: How do I delete game history?**
A: Delete the `chess_arena.db` file. It will auto-recreate on next run.

**Q: Can I use this for engine testing?**
A: Absolutely! Perfect for comparing engine strengths and testing parameters.
